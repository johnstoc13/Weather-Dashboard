# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This project includes an application that gets the current weather for a selected city, along with a 5 day forecast. It also displays the most recent searches on the page.

## Requirements

Functional, deployed application
GitHub repository with README describing the project
Current and future weather conditions for the selected city
City is added to the search history
Current weather displays city name, date, icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and uv index
UV index displays favorable, moderate or severe conditions indicated by color
Future 5 day forecast displays date, icon, temperature and humidity
When city in search history is selected, then current and forecasted weather is displayed for that city
Previously searched city and forecast is displayed upon opening the application

## Deployment

## Notes

This Weather Dashboard was built using jQuery, Bootstrap and Font Awesome. I also used moment.js to get date info for the forecast. I found the API query to be challenging at first, but once I was able to access the data in console.log, I was able to get that data onto the page fairly easily. This was a fun and involved assignment that encompassed the last 6 weeks of the course in its entirety.
